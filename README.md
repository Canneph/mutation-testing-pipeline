# Mutation Testing Pipeline

Automation tooling + analysis for mutation testing open-source Python projects.

## What’s here
- Per-project scripts/configs to run mutation testing
- Added/targeted tests (as patches)
- Results summaries and surviving-mutant analysis

## Structure
- `projects/` — each target project (scripts, config, patches, results)
- `docs/` — methodology notes

## Case Studies
- TheAlgorithms/Python — mutation testing on Haralick descriptor implementation
